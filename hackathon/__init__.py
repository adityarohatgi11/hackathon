"""Top-level *hackathon* package initialisation.

The package re-exports frequently used sub-modules at the global scope so
that they can be imported plainly, e.g. ``import api_client`` instead of
``from hackathon import api_client``.  This is mostly for backward
compatibility with the existing test-suite and third-party notebooks.

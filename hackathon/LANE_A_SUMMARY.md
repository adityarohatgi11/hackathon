forecast = forecaster.predict_next(prices, periods=24)
# Returns: timestamp, predicted_price, ﾏダenergy, ﾏダhash, ﾏダtoken

# Current market data for optimization
inventory = get_inventory()
# Returns: power_total, power_available, battery_soc, gpu_utilization, alerts
```

### For Lane C (Auction & Dispatch):
```python  
# Real-time system state
inventory = get_inventory()
# Returns: battery_soc, power_total, power_available, temperature, efficiency

# Market status for auction timing
status = get_market_status()
# Returns: market_open, current_price, volatility, demand_level, congestion
```

### For Lane D (UI & LLM):
```python
# JSON-serializable data for dashboard
prices = get_prices()           # Historical price data with features
forecast = forecaster.predict_next(prices)  # Future price predictions
importance = forecaster.feature_importance()  # Model interpretability
```

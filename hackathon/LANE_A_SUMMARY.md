status = get_market_status()
# Returns: market_open, current_price, volatility, demand_level, congestion
```

### For Lane D (UI & LLM):
```python
# JSON-serializable data for dashboard
prices = get_prices()           # Historical price data with features
forecast = forecaster.predict_next(prices)  # Future price predictions
importance = forecaster.feature_importance()  # Model interpretability
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
The deployment script automatically finds an available port. If you see "Port X is already in use", the script will try the next available port.

### MARA API Issues
If the MARA API is unavailable, the system will automatically use realistic fallback data to ensure the dashboard remains functional.

### Dependencies
Required packages are automatically checked and installed by the deployment script:
- streamlit
- pandas  
- plotly
- numpy
